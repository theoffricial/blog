# The Isomorphic Code Confusion ðŸ”®

The less obvious complication is browser compatibility.

Both Browsers and The NodeJS ecosystems initially started separate, but since packages bundlers tools like `webpack`, `parcels`, `rollup` and others enabled CommonJS modules to be used in the browser, the scene of isomorphic code, which runs both under NodeJS and the browser, has exploded.
Which caused everything to mixed up but where conflicts happens from time to time.

This is why `Transpilers` in the JS eco-system are so fundamental component, so let's understand what are they compared to compilers.
