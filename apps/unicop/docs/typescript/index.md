## Intro

Developing projects in JavaScript, especially big ones, is complicated.

As a JS project gets bigger, or even more importantly, more people join the project, issues like lack of structure, lack of auto-completion during development, exhausting maintenance, early bug detections, etc. all these reasons slow the development, and in these exact issues TypeScript shines üå†.

When I need to summarize TypeScript's pros into a single word, I choose to say "compiler" (although "transpiler" is more correct term - see **[Compiler vs. Transpiler](./glossary/compiler-vs-transpiler.md)**).
But pros comes with cons, which in a single word, I choose "complex-ier" because TypeScript adds complexity to the development process, the most obvious one to state is that a build step required.

Although many individuals and organizations recognize TypeScript's pros, my own experience had taught me that many "recognizers" do not understand TypeScript's cons or how TypeScript really works, which too-often creates frustration and confusion for many developers.

Here I'm working hard to share knowledge and let you truly understand how to work with TypeScript and the JS eco-system better.
