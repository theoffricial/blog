# Run-time 🏷

In computer science, runtime, run time, or execution time is the final phase of a computer program's life cycle, in which the code is being executed on the computer's central processing unit (CPU) as machine code. In other words, "runtime" is the running phase of a program.

A runtime error is detected after or during the execution (running state) of a program, whereas a [compile-time](./compile-time.md) error is detected by the [compiler](./compiler.md) before the program is ever executed.
