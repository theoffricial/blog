# Software Foundations üèó

I've started working on this blog thinking to build a strong foundation for the JavaScript ecosystem, but eventually I find that many of JavaScript foundations, are actually not specific for JavaScript, but more about software in general, while JavaScript simply just takes those foundations to the extreme.

Unlike other ecosystems, the JS ecosystem is messy, in comparison to language like C# and Java, an integral part of it grows bottom-up with no "regulation".

I believe that building yourself strong foundations is key to build advanced understanding, and great outputs on top of it. <br />

Here I group foundation terms that are relevant for software in general, but I focus on the terms that are crucial to build strong [JavaScript ecosystem foundations](../js-es/intro.md).

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
