# Compile-time 🏷

In computer science, compile time (or compile-time) describes the time window during which a computer program is [compiled](./compiler.md). The term is used as an adjective to describe concepts related to the context of program compilation, as opposed to concepts related to the context of program execution ([runtime](./run-time.md)).
