# What Is In Here ðŸ§ª

Unit testing is the most fundamental level of testing, it has its own theory and what it is possible to achieve with.

Unlike other superficial unit testing guide, I cover here high value cases for unit testing, and cover where unit tests is limited and you should consider use other test level.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList items={
[
{
type: 'category',
label: 'Easy to Test Scenarios ðŸ§­',
items: [
{
type: 'link',
docId: 'testing/unit/easy-to-test-scenarios/intro',
href: '/blog/testing/unit/easy-to-test-scenarios/intro',
label: 'Easy to Test Scenarios ðŸ§­'
},
],
collapsed: true,
collapsible: true,
}
]
} />
