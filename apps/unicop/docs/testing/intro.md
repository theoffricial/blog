# What Is In Here ðŸš€

Personally I feel for a long time, that people discuss a lot about testing in general, and unit tests specifically, but many times not doing anything about it, and most of they time writing tests they are never well organized, or truly understood.

I believe that everything that's done well, starts from whether you have strong principles/philosophy understanding of it.

Here I write about how I see the value of testing and what I've learned while developing my testing foundations.

Personally I mainly work in the [JavaScript ecosystem](../js-es/intro.md) with the [Jest](../js-es/testing-frameworks/jest/intro.md) [testing framework](../js-es/testing-frameworks/intro.md).

Testing is a huge topic, so don't do not underestimate it.

<!-- ## Introduction âœ¨

Too many people and organizations procrastinate to enter into tests and develop expertise in it, but it is wrong, because tests, even the simplest form of "unit" test learn you a lot about code, modularity, quality and so much more.

Tests are the difference between being someone who knows how to write code and being a professional software developer.

In this blog I discuss about the theory behind tests and how to work practically with the JavaScript [jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework, I chose to work with jest because I like JS and for historical reasons, so I deep-dive into how jest works, but I think that most of the testing frameworks share the same complexities because all of them tries to solve the same problem for developers, so even if you are not a JS developer or not using jest, I think you can still get value from the advance contents I write about jest. -->
