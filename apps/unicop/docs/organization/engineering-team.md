Engineering Team Plan should thought about

Senior Management - The Decision Makers

- CEO
- CTO, and VP Engineering
- CPO
- Head of Design
- CRO - chief of revenue
- CFO - finance
- Legal
- COO - Operations
- Data and DevOps
- Depends & Dependent Engineering teams

WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR ALL OF THEM, TO MAKE THEIR DECISION MAKING EASIER AND BENEFICIAL TO US

TL responsibilities

- Respond to all members' personal needs and goals
- Task Prioritization
- The Team Accountability
- Detecting dependencies ahead
- Make sure colleagues satisfied
- Reviewing tech design (optionally delegates when feels high-trust)
- Accountable to build a long-term work plan for the team (to increase velocity)
- Manage Scrum (can be delegated)

Engineers

- Job execution
- Feature lead and review tech design.
  - Provide professional opinion.
- Manage a track for engineering states and environments.
- Document matrix requests.
- Reflect constraints, blockers, progress, etc.
- Research technologies with potential value.
- Explain QA what they should test clearly.
- Create test cases that a 8-year old kid can understand
- Raise engineering metrics that we should monitor, and explain their impact
- Increase product quality by deciding on pipeline actions
- Track constraint/blockers that prevent us to improve our technology, e.g. what features we need Vite to support to stop using CRA.

Accountable of:

- Feature leads & tech designs
- Reflecting constraints, blockers, progress, etc.
- Raise Engineering OKRs to push, business metrics, make system stable

QA

- No clear QA plan, should block and ticket should be split into research non-QA ticket
- Create e2e test plan cases that a 8-year old kid can understand
- Write automation tests
- Be able to run unit tests
- Reflect high frequency integration tests, e.g. get-gift-by-id

Designer

- Build a shared language with the team, according to constraints

Type of "Tasks"

- Research - for new technologies/products/before vague tickets
- Design review - for features
- POC new technology
- Review - tech designs, big PRs
- Deployment - for complicated deployments
- Availability - for stakeholders?
- For tickets breakdown/planning
