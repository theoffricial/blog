Personally I feel, that the unit tests and testing in general is discussed a lot but not well organized,
Here I tried to give answers to all the theory questions, tips, and also how jest in which I use on a daily basis really work.

Testing is a huge topic, and frameworks like `jest` aren't just "another library" it is a whole new world.
Tests determine how quality your product is.

## Introduction ‚ú®

Too many people and organizations procrastinate to enter into tests and develop expertise in it, but it is wrong, because tests, even the simplest form of "unit" test learn you a lot about code, modularity, quality and so much more.

Tests are the difference between being someone who knows how to write code and being a professional software developer.

In this blog I discuss about the theory behind tests and how to work practically with the JavaScript [jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework, I chose to work with jest because I like JS and for historical reasons, so I deep-dive into how jest works, but I think that most of the testing frameworks share the same complexities because all of them tries to solve the same problem for developers, so even if you are not a JS developer or not using jest, I think you can still get value from the advance contents I write about jest.
