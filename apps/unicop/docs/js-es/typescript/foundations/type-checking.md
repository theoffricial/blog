# TypeScript `type-checking`

In TypeScript, type checking is [static](../../foundations/type-checking.md#static-type-checking), meaning types are being checked at [compile-time](../../foundations/compile-time.md).

The type checking action occur before TypeScript [emits](./emit.md) the source code.
