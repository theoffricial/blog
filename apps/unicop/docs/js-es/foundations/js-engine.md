# JavaScript Engine üè∑

A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.

JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model.

The use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers. For example, the `V8` engine is a core component of the `Node.js` and `Deno` runtime systems.

Since ECMAScript is the standardized specification of JavaScript, ECMAScript engine is another name for these engines.
