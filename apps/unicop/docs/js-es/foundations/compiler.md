# Compiler 🏷

A **compiler** is an umbrella term to describe a program that takes source code written in one language and produce a (or many) output file in some other language (source-to-destination). In practice we mostly use this term to describe a compiler such as gcc which takes in C code as input and produces a binary executable (machine code) as output.

Another term that many developers are confusing with compiler is [transpiler](./transpiler.md) which is source-to-source compiler.

### Compiler Examples:

- The JavaScript Interpreter - which converts JavaScript code into a machine-level code
- gcc - which is the C language compiler - converts C code and downgrades it into binary executable code.
