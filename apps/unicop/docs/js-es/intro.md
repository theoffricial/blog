# What Is In Here 🚀

Materials in all levels that will help you master the JavaScript ecosystem - foundations level materials, like JS modules, to advance topics, like how to set up incremental build with multiple projects in TypeScript.

In comparison to languages like C#, or Java, the JavaScript ecosystem is messy, and that's because the JS ecosystem mostly grows bottom-up, by the community, which lacks "regulation".

While the ecosystem is getting more mature these days, it is becoming more advanced at the same time.

The combination of messy and advance means that without strongly understanding the foundations of this ecosystem, you will find it very hard to build stuff, and decrease your ability to integrate tools to build stuff, and developers are builders.

Here I do my best to spread solid foundations, because foundations is key for growth.
