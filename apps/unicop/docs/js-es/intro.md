# What Is In Here 🚀

Everything to master the JavaScript ecosystem, from foundations to advance topics.

Unlike other ecosystems, the JS ecosystem is messy, in comparison to languages like C# and Java, an integral part of it grows bottom-up with no "regulation".

While it is getting more mature these days, it also is becoming more advanced.

The combination of messy and advance means that without strongly understanding the foundations of this ecosystem, you will find it very hard to build stuff, and decrease your ability to integrate tools to build stuff, and developers are builders.

Here I do my best to spread solid foundations, because foundations is key for growth.
