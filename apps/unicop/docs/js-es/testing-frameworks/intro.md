# What Is In Here ðŸ§ª

If you wish to know more about JavaScript testing frameworks, here I focus on how-to-use them, explain architecture, and so on.

Tests always were underestimated, and will probably stay with this status, because it is mentally easy to skip them and focus on "growth".

Although many don't write tests, and even more don't really understand the theory behind testing, testing frameworks are playing a core component in any ecosystem they exists, and the same applies to JavaScript.

Testing frameworks, besides their necessity, their architecture is complicated and impressive at the same time. Testing frameworks have to deal with fundamental issues that their solutions are great references to be inspired of, those issues has a big overlap with issues module bundlers, and dev servers face.
