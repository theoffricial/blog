Too many popular tools in the JS eco-system have mixed the difference between of compiler and transpiler, that causes a huge confusion among developers.

From my experience, the ability to differentiate between the terms improved me dramatically as a JS eco-system developer in my ability to search, learn new tools and to communicate more accurately.

In the JS eco-system the only compiler exists is the JavaScript Interpreter, while all other tools are actually transpilers.
